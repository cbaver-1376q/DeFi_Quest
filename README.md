# DeFi Quest: A Gamified Yield Farming Platform

DeFi Quest transforms the complex world of decentralized finance (DeFi) yield farming into an engaging and accessible gaming experience, powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. By gamifying the user experience, we lower the entry barriers for users, enabling them to participate in and learn about privacy-driven DeFi strategies through interactive missions.

## The Problem We Address

Navigating the intricate landscape of DeFi can be daunting for newcomers. The steep learning curve, coupled with the risks of managing investments, often discourages potential users. Traditional yield farming strategies can be hard to grasp and even harder to implement effectively without prior knowledge. This can lead to missed opportunities and investment mismanagement, fostering a negative impression of the DeFi space.

## The FHE Solution

DeFi Quest leverages Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**, to implement Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This revolutionary technology allows us to encrypt user investment strategies while still enabling computations to occur without sacrificing privacy. Users can confidently engage in DeFi operations, knowing their encrypted strategies and portfolios remain secure, fostering trust and safety in their financial interactions.

## Key Features

- **Gamified Missions:** Users complete exciting quests that correspond to real DeFi actions (like providing liquidity), making learning enjoyable and engaging.
- **Encrypted Portfolios:** All user investment strategies are securely encrypted using FHE, ensuring confidentiality throughout their DeFi journey.
- **APR Boost Achievements:** Game accomplishments translate into enhanced yield rates, incentivizing users to actively participate in the platform.
- **Guild Collaboration:** The platform supports collaborative investment strategies through a guild system, allowing users to work together for maximum benefit.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK:** The core component for confidential computing, providing advanced encryption functionalities.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Hardhat/Foundry:** Development environments for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Solidity:** The programming language used for smart contracts.

## Project Structure

Here's the organized directory structure of the DeFi Quest project:

```
DeFi_Quest/
├── contracts/
│   └── DeFi_Quest.sol
├── src/
│   ├── index.js
│   └── gameLogic.js
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.js
├── test/
│   └── testDeFiQuest.js
├── package.json
└── hardhat.config.js
```

## Installation Guide

To get started with the DeFi Quest project, ensure you have installed Node.js and your preferred Ethereum development environment (either Hardhat or Foundry). Then, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Download the project** (do not use `git clone`).
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Build & Run Guide

Once the installation is complete, you can build and test the project by executing the commands below:

1. To compile the smart contracts, run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. To execute the tests, use:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. To deploy the contracts to a local blockchain simulation, run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

## Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simplified example of how the game logic might interact with the user’s encrypted portfolio:

```javascript
const { encryptStrategy, computeYield } = require('./zamaFHEHelper');

async function executeGameMission(userStrat) {
    // Encrypt the user's investment strategy
    const encryptedStrategy = encryptStrategy(userStrat);

    // Compute the potential yield based on the encrypted data
    const returnYield = await computeYield(encryptedStrategy);
    
    console.log(`Your projected yield is: ${returnYield}`);
}

// Example user input
const userInvestmentStrategy = {
    asset: "ETH",
    amount: 5
};

executeGameMission(userInvestmentStrategy);
```

In this code, the user's investment strategy is encrypted before performing yield calculations, showcasing the advantage of utilizing Zama's FHE technology.
